# AbleSync

**‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Version - Not Stable**

AbleSync is an Electron application that synchronizes transport information (play/stop, position, tempo) between multiple Ableton Live instances over UDP multicast. Perfect for live performances, collaboration, or multi-room setups where you need perfectly synchronized playback.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time synchronization** of Ableton Live transport between multiple computers
- **UDP Multicast** communication (no IP configuration required)
- **Master/Slave architecture** - one master controls multiple slaves
- **Adjustable sync threshold** for fine-tuning synchronization precision
- **System tray integration** appears in system tray on MacOS
- **Live connection monitoring** with visual status indicators
- **Comprehensive logging** with save/export functionality

## üìã Requirements

- **macOS** (currently Mac-only, other platforms planned)
- **Ableton Live**
- **Network connection** between devices (same network/subnet for multicast)
- **Remote Scripts** added and configured as described in ableton-js [README](https://github.com/leolabs/ableton-js/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites). AbletonJS directory is available in this repository

## üì• Installation

### Download
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/joohnnyvv/AbleSync/releases) page
2. Download the latest `.dmg` file for macOS
3. Open the `.dmg` and drag AbleSync to your Applications folder

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ablesync.git
cd ablesync
npm install
npm run build
```

## üéØ Usage

### Quick Start
1. **Connect the computers** into a single network (preferably via a direct LAN cable connection)
2. **Launch AbleSync** on all computers you want to sync
3. **Start Ableton Live** on each computer
4. **On the master computer**: Click "Uruchom jako master" (Run as Master)
5. **On slave computers**: Click "Uruchom jako slave" (Run as Slave)
6. **Start playback** on the master - slaves will automatically follow

### Master Mode
The master computer controls transport for all connected slaves:
- Controls play/stop for entire network
- Broadcasts tempo changes
- Sends position updates for synchronization

### Slave Mode
Slave computers follow the master's transport:
- Automatically start/stop with master
- Sync to master's tempo
- Maintain precise position synchronization
- **Adjustable sync threshold**

### Network Configuration
- Uses **UDP Multicast** on `224.0.1.100:8080`
- **No manual IP configuration** required
- All devices must be on the same network/subnet
- Firewall may need to allow UDP traffic on port 8080

## üîß Configuration

### Sync Threshold (Slave Mode)
The sync threshold determines how precise the position synchronization should be:
- **Lower values** (0.001-0.005): Tighter sync, more CPU usage
- **Higher values** (0.01-0.1): Looser sync, less CPU usage
- **Default**: 0.01
- Adjustable in real-time through the UI when running as slave

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure all devices are on the same network
- Check firewall settings for UDP port 8080
- Verify Ableton Live is running

### Sync Problems
- Adjust sync threshold if experiencing drift
- Check network latency between devices
- Ensure stable network connection
- Monitor logs for error messages

### Performance
- Lower sync threshold = more network traffic
- Multiple slaves increase master's CPU usage
- Close unnecessary applications for better performance

## üìä Status Indicators

- üî¥ **Red**: Disconnected (no Ableton Live or network connection)
- üü° **Yellow**: Partially connected (either Ableton OR network, not both)
- üü¢ **Green**: Fully connected (both Ableton Live and network active)

## üóÇÔ∏è Logs

- **Real-time logging** in the main window
- **Export logs** to text files for debugging
- **Clear logs** to reduce memory usage
- Automatic log rotation (keeps last 50 lines)

## üöß Current Limitations

- Releases **macOS only**
- **Polish UI** (English localization planned)
- **Alpha stability** (expect bugs and crashes)
- **Manual deployment** (no auto-updater yet)
- **Basic error handling** (more robust error recovery planned)

## üîÆ Planned Features

- [ ] English language support
- [ ] Auto-updater integration
- [ ] Advanced sync options
